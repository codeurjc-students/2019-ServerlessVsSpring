# Serverless Vs Spring
In this repository we are going to compare the way we have to develop applications. We will start with microservices made with Spring and we will study the possibilities and disadvantages of serverless development with AWS Lambda.

How I have come to the following conclusions and why I have opted for some of the different options can be seen [here](https://medium.com/serverlessvsspring)
