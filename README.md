# Serverless Vs Spring [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/codeurjc-students/2019-ServerlessVsSpring)](https://github.com/codeurjc-students/2019-ServerlessVsSpring/blob/master/LICENSE)
In this repository we are going to compare the way we have to develop applications. We will start with microservices made with Spring and we will study the possibilities and disadvantages of serverless development with AWS Lambda.

How I have come to the following conclusions and why I have opted for some of the different options can be seen [here](https://medium.com/serverlessvsspring).

# Comparison Items
### The comparison process will be divided in the following microservices:

- [x] **Configuration of ~~Visual Studio Code~~ IntelliJ IDEA to use it with Java and AWS SAM**

  How to configure ~~VSCode~~ IntelliJ IDE and prepare it to be used with Java and AWS SAM: [About AWS SAM with IntelliJ IDEA](sections/IntelliJ-AWS-SAM-Java).
        
- [x] **REST in Spring Vs AWS Lambda**

  Comparative using REST in a common Java stack and a Serverless: [Comparative](sections/REST-AWS-Spring).

- [ ] **Single-page application (SPA): Non-Serverless deployment vs Serverless deployment**

  How to deploy a static web normally and how it is done in an Amazon S3 bucket: [Deployment comparative](sections/SPA-Deployment).
  
- [ ] **Users Management**

  Users management using a typical authentication system in Spring and how to do it using AWS services instead.

- [ ] **Files**

  Managing files in different environments.

- [ ] **BBDD**

- [ ] **Background tasks**

  Use of background tasks (i.e. generate pdfs...) in both environments.

- [ ] **Notifications**

  Creating notifications for users making use of Websockets.

- [ ] **Average cost**

  Approximate cost of maintaining a server Vs using cloud services.
